# AgSolution-AI-based-framework-for-crop-health-monitoring
1. PROJECT STATEMENT:
To design and develop an application using Machine learning and Deep learning
technology which will focus on farming technology and solve the various constraints
of the Agriculture Sector.
2. AREA:
Domain: AI, ML, Data Science, Cognitive Computing & NLP, Application Domain: Agriculture,Research Theme: Environment
3. PROJECT SCOPE:
We are developing an application that is comprised of four modules:
1.The first module is a deep learning model for disease diagnosis that uses artificial
intelligence
2.The second model describes a crop recommendation system that provides suggestion for
crops to grow based on the nutrient content of the soil along with some environmental
parameters.
3.In the third module, we will be predicting the fertility level of soil by applying Random
Forest and Support Vector Machine techniques, respectively.
4.The fourth module is that of crop yield prediction based on different parameters.
4. PROJECT LIMITATIONS:
1. For the time being, the project can only be used for one crop; however, more crops can
be added, and the app's functionality can be improved.
2.There are only four modules included, additional modules can be added in the future.
3.The technology is not compatible with drones. It can be further integrated to assist
farmers in monitoring crop health and increasing yield.
5. PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
Primary Goal:
The primary goal is to design and develop an app that focuses on mobile farming
technology and addresses the various limitations of Agriculture.
Secondary Goal:
Create a web-based system model that can provide agricultural information from
anywhere and at any time.
Mobile is used to operate the system model. Each farmer can access the information at
the same time, eliminating the waste of time and energy.
